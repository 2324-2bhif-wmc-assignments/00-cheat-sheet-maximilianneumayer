            <dd>
                <p>
                    Resources in the web are normally addressed via URLs (uniform resource locator).
                    URLs describe the specific location of a resource on a particular server.
                    They tell you exactly how to fetch a resource from a precise, fixed location.

            <dd>
                <p>
                    A URL typically has 9 parts, the protocol (or scheme), subdomain, domain name, top level domain, port, path, query, parameters, and fragment.
                    But the 2 general components of a URL, are the scheme and the domain name (server). These two are needed in every URL.

                <p>
                    A web server is a software application or hardware device that serves as the foundation of the World Wide Web.
                    It hosts and delivers web content to clients (normally web browsers). It's main purpose is to handle incoming requests for web resources (HTML pages, images, CSS files, JS files) and respond by handing out the requested date to the users over the internet.

                <p>
                    A web server's primarily use is to process and manage HTTP and HTTPS requests and respond accordingly to them.
                    It also serves and manages web content, allowing users to access websites and web applications over the internet.
                    A web server can also accept and store resources sent from the user agent if configured to do so.

                <h3 class="question">How can content be stored on a web server?</h3>
            </dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
                    Content can be stored in different ways.
                    Here are some examples:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Static Files</h4>

                        <p>
                            Static content (HTML pages, images, stylesheets, JS files and downloadable documents) can be stored directly on the web server's file system.
                            When a user requests one of these files, the web server retrieves it from the specified directory and gives it to the client as a response.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Content Management Systems (CMS)</h4>

                        <p>
                            CMS platforms like WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, etc. store content (articles, images and videos) in databases.
                            This content is dynamically generated when a user requests a web page.
                            The interface which CMS systems provides for users allows them to create, edit and organize content without directly manipulating files.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Databases</h4>

                        <p>
                            Dynamic Websites and web applications often store content, user date and application data in databases.
                            Content is stored in database tables, and server-side code retrieves and populates web pages with this data.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="question">How is content in webpages described?</h3>
            </dt>
            <dd>

                <p>
                    The content on webpages is described, structured and formatted primarily by HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
                    HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): HTML is used to structure and describe the content of webpages. It is the core markup language.
                    CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): CSS is used to describe the presentation and styling of HTML elements.
                    JavaScript: JavaScript adds interactivity and behaviour to webpages.

                    A web client is used for connecting to a web server over HTTP. It requests and retrieves information or resources form web servers on the World Wide Web.
                    Typically, it's a web browser like chrome or edge, which displays web pages from the server and also allows the user to interact with the web server.
                    Sometimes a web client is referred to as user agent.

                    All in all a web client or user agent enables users to interact with the World Wide Web. It handles requests and responses, renders web content, executes scripts, gives a user interface, and ensures a secure and user-friendly web browsing experience.

                <p>No, web clients and web browsers aren't the same, even though they are often referred as the same.</p>

                <p>
                    A web client is a more general term that refers to any software or application that interacts with the web servers to request and retrieve web content.
                    This includes web browsers, but also software or programs that communicate with web-based services or resources.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A web browser is a specific type of web client that is designed for displaying and rendering web content for the user with a good user-interface.
                    Web browsers are optimized for viewing HTML, CSS and JavaScript content. They also provide a graphical interface to navigate around the world wide web.
                    An example for a web browser would be chrome or edge.
