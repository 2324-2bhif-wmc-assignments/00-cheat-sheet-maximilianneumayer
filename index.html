                            What are the most essential technologies that made the World Wide Web such a success?
                            <p>
                                URL (uniform resource locator), which is the addressing scheme to find a document.
                                HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol), The Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems that allows users to communicate data on the World Wide Web
                                HTML (hypertext markup language), which formats pages containing hypertext links. HTML also is the set of markup symbols or codes inserted into a file, which is meant to be displayed on the internet. HTML gives browsers the information on how to display a web page's words and images.
                                CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
                                JS (JavaScript)
                                Web Server, Server like facebook.com which can response to a request from a Web Client
                                Web Client, a browser which the user uses to request html-files from the Web Server
                            </p>

                            How are resources (html pages, images, etc.) addressed in the web?
                            <p>
                                Resources in the web are normally addressed via URLs (uniform resource locator).
                                URLs describe the specific location of a resource on a particular server.
                                They tell you exactly how to fetch a resource from a precise, fixed location.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            What are the general components of an url?
                            <p>
                                A URL typically has 9 parts, the protocol (or scheme), subdomain, domain name, top level domain, port, path, query, parameters, and fragment.
                                But the 2 general components of a URL, are the scheme, the domain name (server). These two are needed in every URL.

                            What is a web server?
                            <p>
                                A web server is a software application or hardware device that serves as the foundation of the World Wide Web.
                                It hosts and delivers web content to clients (normally web browsers). It's main purpose is to handle incoming requests for web resources (HTML pages, images, CSS files, JS files) and respond by handing out the requested date to the users over the internet.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                            <p>
                                A web server's primarily use is to process and manage HTTP and HTTPS requests and respond accordingly to them. It also serves and manages web content, allowing users to access websites and web applications over the internet.

                            How can content be stored on a web server?
                            <p>
                                Content can be stored in different ways.
                                Here are some examples:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <h5>Static Files</h5>

                                    <p>
                                        Static content (HTML pages, images, stylesheets, JS files and downloadable documents) can be stored directly on the web server's file system.
                                        When a user requests one of these files, the web server retrieves it from the specified directory and gives it to the client as a response.
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <h5>Content Management Systems (CMS)</h5>

                                    <p>
                                        CMS platforms like WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, etc. store content (articles, images and videos) in databases.
                                        This content is dynamically generated when a user requests a web page.
                                        The interface which CMS systems provides for users allows them to create, edit and organize content without directly manipulating files.
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <h5>Databases</h5>

                                    <p>
                                        Dynamic Websites and web applications often store content, user date and application data in databases.
                                        Content is stored in database tables, and server-side code retrieves and populates web pages with this data.
                                    </p>
                                </li>

                        <li>
                            How is content in webpages described?

                            The content on webpages is described, structured and formatted primarily by HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

                            <ol>

                        What is a web client?

                        <p>
                            A web client is used for connecting to a web server over HTTP. It requests and retrieves information or resources form web servers on the World Wide Web.
                            Typically, it's a web browser like chrome or edge, which displays web pages from the server and also allows the user to interact with the web server.
                            Sometimes a web client is referred to as user agent.
                        </p>

                            All in all a web client or user agent enables users to interact with the World Wide Web. It handles requests and responses, renders web content, executes scripts, gives a user interface, and ensures a secure and user-friendly web browsing experience.

                        Web Client and Web Browser is the same

                        <p>
                            No, web clients and web browsers aren't the same, even though they are often referred as the same.

                            A web client is a more general term that refers to any software or application that interacts with the web servers to request and retrieve web content.
                            This includes web browsers, but also software or programs that communicate with web-based services or resources.

                            A web browser is a specific type of web client that is designed for displaying and rendering web content for the user with a good user-interface.
                            Web browsers are optimized for viewing HTML, CSS and JavaScript content. They also provide a graphical interface to navigate around the world wide web.
                            An example for a web browser would be chrome or edge.

                                An html document needs to start with a &lt;!DOCTYPE html &gt; declaration.
                                This isn't a html tag, it is information to the browser about what type of document this is.

                                &lt;html&gt; tag represents the root of an HTML document.
                                The &lt;html&gt; tag also contains all HTML-tags except the &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; tag.
                                In the html tag you can also declare the language with the "lang" attribute which helps search engines and browsers.
                            </dd>
                            <dt>
                                &lt;head&gt;
                            </dt>
                            <dd>
                                The &lt;head&gt; element is a container for metadata. (data about the html document, which is not displayed)

                                Elements which can go into the head element:

                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        &lt;title&gt; (required in every HTML document)
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                            &lt;style&gt;
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        &lt;base&gt;
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        &lt;link&gt;
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        &lt;meta&gt;
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        &lt;script&gt;
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        &lt;noscript&gt;
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </dd>
                            <dt>
                                &lt;meta&gt;
                            </dt>
                            <dd>
                                The &lt;meta&gt; tag defines metadata about an HTML document.
                                &lt;meta&gt; tags always go in the &lt;head&gt; element.
                                &lt;meta&gt; tags are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings and are being used by browsers, search engines and other web services.
                                Metadata won't be shown on the website, but it is machine parsable.

                                Attributes from the &lt;meta&gt; tag:
                                <br>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        charset

                                        <p>
                                            value: character_set
                                            <br>
